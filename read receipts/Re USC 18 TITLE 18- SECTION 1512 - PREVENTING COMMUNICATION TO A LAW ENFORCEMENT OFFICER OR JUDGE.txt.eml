> 26 U.S. Code Ã?Â§ 6662 - Imposition of accuracy-related penalty on 
> underpayments
>
> Ã?Â§ 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.
> (a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related penalty on 
> any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in section 6664(a) 
> and Ã?Â§ 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a return if such portion is 
> attributable to one or more of the following types of misconduct:
>
> (1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see Ã?Â§ 1.6662-3);
>
> (2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see Ã?Â§ 1.6662-4); or
>
> (3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under chapter 1 
> (Ã¢Â?Â?substantial valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â or Ã¢Â?Â?gross 
> valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â), provided the applicable dollar 
> limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see Ã?Â§ 
> 1.6662-5).
>
>
> (b) Amount of penalty -
>
> (1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20 
> percent of the portion of an underpayment
> of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any of 
> the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs
> (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph 
> (b)(2) of this section.
>
> (2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.
> In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section 
> 6662(h)(2) and Ã?Â§ 1.6662-5(e)(2),
> the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the 
> portion of an underpayment of tax required
> to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation 
> misstatement, provided the applicable
> dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.
>
>
>
> Ã?Â§ 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under 
> chapter 1.
> (a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in 
> section 6664(a) and
> Ã?Â§ 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle A 
> of the Code that is
> required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial 
> valuation misstatement
> under chapter 1 (Ã¢Â?Â?substantial valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â), 
> there is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.
>
> Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a 
> gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1
> (Ã¢Â?Â?gross valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â).
> No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion 
> of an underpayment
> that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement 
> unless the aggregate
> of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or 
> gross valuation misstatements
> exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as 
> provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
> (b) and
> (f)(2) of this section.
> This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable 
> cause and good faith exception to this penalty
> set forth in Ã?Â§ 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception 
> to this penalty.
>
> (b) Dollar limitation.
> No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year 
> unless
>
> the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to 
> substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
> ($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as 
> defined in section 1361(a)(1));
>
> or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).
>
> This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which 
> there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.
>
>
>
> (e) Definitions -
>
> (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
> There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
> basis of any property claimed on a
> return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
> correct amount.
>
> (2) Gross valuation misstatement.
> There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
> of any property claimed on a return of tax
> imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.
>
> (3) Property.
> For purposes of this section, the term Ã¢Â?Â?propertyÃ¢Â?Â refers to 
> both tangible and intangible property.
> Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
> and inventory.
> Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not 
> to compete, leaseholds, patents,
> contract rights, debts and choses in action.
>
>
> (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -
>
> (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial 
> or gross.
> The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
> misstatement on a return is
> made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that 
> property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
> and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value 
> of 100.
>
> Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
> property-by-property basis,
> there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
> B, but not with respect to property A,
> even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
> correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.
>
> (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
> dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
> the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is 
> attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
> is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable 
> to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.
>
> Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
> is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
> property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
> Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
> substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
> in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied 
> if the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the 
> misstatement of the value of property C, when aggregated with the 
> portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
> of the value of property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of 
> most corporations).
>
> (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.
>
> The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
> correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 
> percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation 
> misstatement with respect to such property, therefore, and the 
> applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.

>
> Ã?Â§ 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.
> (a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related penalty on 
> any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in section 6664(a) 
> and Ã?Â§ 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a return if such portion is 
> attributable to one or more of the following types of misconduct:
>
> (1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see Ã?Â§ 1.6662-3);
>
> (2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see Ã?Â§ 1.6662-4); or
>
> (3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under chapter 1 
> (Ã¢Â?Â?substantial valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â or Ã¢Â?Â?gross 
> valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â), provided the applicable dollar 
> limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see Ã?Â§ 
> 1.6662-5).
>
>
> (b) Amount of penalty -
>
> (1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20 
> percent of the portion of an underpayment
> of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any of 
> the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs
> (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph 
> (b)(2) of this section.
>
> (2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.
> In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section 
> 6662(h)(2) and Ã?Â§ 1.6662-5(e)(2),
> the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the 
> portion of an underpayment of tax required
> to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation 
> misstatement, provided the applicable
> dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.
>
>
>
> Ã?Â§ 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under 
> chapter 1.
> (a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in 
> section 6664(a) and
> Ã?Â§ 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle A 
> of the Code that is
> required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial 
> valuation misstatement
> under chapter 1 (Ã¢Â?Â?substantial valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â), 
> there is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.
>
> Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a 
> gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1
> (Ã¢Â?Â?gross valuation misstatementÃ¢Â?Â).
> No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion 
> of an underpayment
> that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement 
> unless the aggregate
> of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or 
> gross valuation misstatements
> exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as 
> provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
> (b) and
> (f)(2) of this section.
> This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable 
> cause and good faith exception to this penalty
> set forth in Ã?Â§ 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception 
> to this penalty.
>
> (b) Dollar limitation.
> No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year 
> unless
>
> the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to 
> substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
> ($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as 
> defined in section 1361(a)(1));
>
> or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).
>
> This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which 
> there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.
>
>
>
> (e) Definitions -
>
> (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
> There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
> basis of any property claimed on a
> return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
> correct amount.
>
> (2) Gross valuation misstatement.
> There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
> of any property claimed on a return of tax
> imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.
>
> (3) Property.
> For purposes of this section, the term Ã¢Â?Â?propertyÃ¢Â?Â refers to 
> both tangible and intangible property.
> Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
> and inventory.
> Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not 
> to compete, leaseholds, patents,
> contract rights, debts and choses in action.
>
>
> (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -
>
> (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial 
> or gross.
> The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
> misstatement on a return is
> made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that 
> property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
> and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value 
> of 100.
>
> Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
> property-by-property basis,
> there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
> B, but not with respect to property A,
> even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
> correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.
>
> (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
> dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
> the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is 
> attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
> is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable 
> to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.
>
> Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
> is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
> property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
> Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
> substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
> in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied 
> if the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the 
> misstatement of the value of property C, when aggregated with the 
> portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
> of the value of property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of 
> most corporations).
>
> (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.
>
> The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
> correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 
> percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation 
> misstatement with respect to such property, therefore, and the 
> applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.

      the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring those
      assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will
      not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have
      reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10
      years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a
      natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My
      Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC guidelines,
      holding unlawful assets in custody

      Despite the breach USC code 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.21, 18.215,
      18.225 - do the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged
      concurrent sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do
      I go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been
      returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money,
      however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a
      growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY
      changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would
      be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank
      that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      - as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank,

      been returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my
      money, however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and
      a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent
      YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those
      would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a

=A0=C2=A0 The FDIC insures deposits held at member banks

      the loss of their deposits if an FDIC-insured bank fails. FDIC
      insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United
      States government. Since the FDIC began operations in 1934, no
      depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits.

      ### USC 18. =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7208. Acts affecting a personal finan=
cial interest
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      (a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being
      an officer or employee of the executive branch of the United
      States Government, or of any independent agency of the United
      States, a Federal Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or
      an officer or employee of the District of Columbia, including a
      special Government employee, participates personally and
      substantially as a Government officer or employee, through
      decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of
      advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other
      proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other
      determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation,
      arrest, or other particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he,
      his spouse, minor child, general partner, organization in which he
      is serving as officer, director, trustee, general partner or
      employee, or any person or organization with whom he is
      negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective
      employment, has a financial interest-Shall be subject to the
      penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.
      <br>
      (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-
      <br>
      (1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government
      official responsible for appointment to his or her position of the
      nature and circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding,
      application, request for a ruling or other determination,
      contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other
      particular matter and makes full disclosure of the financial
      interest and receives in advance a written determination made by
      such official that the interest is not so substantial as to be
      deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the
      Government may expect from such officer or employee;
      <br>
      (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of
      Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers
      and employees covered by this section, and published in the
      Federal Register, the financial interest has been exempted from
      the requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or too
      inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the
      Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies;
      <br>
      (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an
      advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory
      Committee Act (including an individual being considered for an
      appointment to such a position), the official responsible for the
      employee's appointment, after review of the financial disclosure
      report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics in
      Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need for the
      individual's services outweighs the potential for a conflict of
      interest created by the financial interest involved...

      (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good
      faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
      <br>
      Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any
      application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or
      any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in
      a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section
      78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the
      light of the circumstances under which it was made false or
      misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to
      any person (not knowing that such statement was false or
      misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have
      purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such
      statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person
      sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge
      that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking to
      enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of
      competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its
      discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of
      such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable

      where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
      expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.

      Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment,
      the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
      before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the

      [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets
      depends on the
      <br>
      integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
      transparent disclosure.
      <br>
      Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
      fraudulent conduct is
      <br>
      antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long
      held that a history of
      <br>
      egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
      participation in the
      <br>
      securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not
      related to the
      <br>
      professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he
      or she engaged
      <br>
      in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies
      on the fairness
      <br>
      and integrity of all persons associated with each of the
      professions covered by the
      <br>
      collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other
      market

      -UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
      <br>
      SEC. 17. (a)
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or
      principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other
      than a company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3)
      (A) and (B)), or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter,
      or principal underwriter, acting as principal-
      <br>
      (1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such
      registered company or to any company controlled by such regis-
      tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of
      which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller
      is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the
      holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited
      with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment
      plan by the depositor thereof;
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from
      any company controlled by such registered company, any security or
      other property (except securities of which the seller is the
      issuer)

      Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
      <br>
      SEC. 17.
      <br>
      (h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
      <br>
      the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of
      association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered
      investment company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which
      such a company is organized or administered, shall contain any
      provision which protects or purports to protect any director or
      officer of such company against any liability to the company or to
      its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by
      reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
      reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
      office.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective
      date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection
      (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration
      of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a
      registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate
      this subsection if prior to said expiration date each such
      director or officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver
      in writing of any protective provision of the instrument to the
      extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and each such
      person subsequently elected or appointed shall before assuming
      office file a similar waiver.
      <br>
      <br>
      (i) After one year from the effective date of this title no
      contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as
      investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
      investment company shall contain any provision which protects or
      purports to protect such person against any liability to such
      company or its security holders to which he would otherwise be
      subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross
      negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his
      reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such
      contract or agreement.

      <br>
      The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper
      district court of the United States or United States court of
      <br>
      any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
      more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
      enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement
      of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in
      respect of any registered investment company for which such person
      so serves or acts:
      <br>
      (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment
      adviser, or depositor; or
      <br>
      (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
      open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
      <br>
      certificate company.
      <br>
      If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross
      abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person
      from acting in such capacity or capacities either permanently or
      for such period of time as it in its discretion shall deem
      appropriate.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      (c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or
      order in the public interest or for the protection of investors,
      to require accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets,
      and other documents and papers relating to registered investment
      companies for such period or periods as the Commission may
      prescribe, and to make the same available for inspection by the
      Commission or any member or representative thereof.

      <br>
      <br>
      (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by
      rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
      <br>
      destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document
      the preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31
      (a) or 32 (c).
      <br>
      (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue
      statement of a material fact in any registration statement,
      application, report, account, record, or other document filed or
      transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is
      required pursuant to section 31 (a).
      <br>
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or
      keeping any such document to omit to state therein any fact
      necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in the
      light of the circumstances under which they were made, from being
      materially misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any
      part of any such document which is signed or certified by an
      accountant or auditor in his capacity as such shall be deemed to
      be made, filed, transmitted, or kept by such accountant or
      auditor, as well as by the person filing, transmitting, or keeping
      the complete document.

      section 6662(h)(2) and =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6662-5(e)(2),
      <br>
      the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the
      portion of an underpayment of tax required
      <br>
      to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross
      valuation misstatement, provided the applicable
      <br>
      dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation missta=
tements under
      chapter 1.
      <br>
      (a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in
      section 6664(a) and
      <br>
      =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapt=
er 1 of
      subtitle A of the Code that is
      <br>
      required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial
      valuation misstatement
      <br>
      under chapter 1 (=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82?substantial valuation mi=
sstatement=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82=C2=9D),
      there is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such
      portion.
      <br>
      <br>
      Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of
      a gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1
      <br>
      (=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82?gross valuation misstatement=C3=83=C2=A2=
=C3=82?=C3=82=C2=9D).
      <br>
      No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a
      portion of an underpayment
      <br>
      that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation
      misstatement unless the aggregate
      <br>
      of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or
      gross valuation misstatements
      <br>
      exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as
      provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
      <br>
      (b) and
      <br>
      (f)(2) of this section.
      <br>
      This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable
      cause and good faith exception to this penalty
      <br>
      set forth in =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disc=
losure
      exception to this penalty.
      <br>
      <br>
      (b) Dollar limitation.
      <br>
      No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable
      year unless
      <br>
      <br>
      the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable
      to substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
      <br>
      ($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation
      (as defined in section 1361(a)(1));
      <br>
      <br>
      or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).
      <br>
      <br>
      This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for
      which there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      (e) Definitions -
      <br>
      <br>
      (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
      adjusted basis of any property claimed on a
      <br>
      return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of
      the correct amount.
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) Gross valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted
      basis of any property claimed on a return of tax
      <br>
      imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
      amount.
      <br>
      <br>
      (3) Property.
      <br>
      For purposes of this section, the term =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82?pr=
operty=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82=C2=9D refers
      to both tangible and intangible property.
      <br>
      Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
      fixtures and inventory.
      <br>
      Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants
      not to compete, leaseholds, patents,
      <br>
      contract rights, debts and choses in action.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -
      <br>
      <br>
      (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are
      substantial or gross.
      <br>
      The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
      valuation misstatement on a return is
      <br>
      made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that
      property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
      <br>
      and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a
      value of 100.
      <br>
      <br>
      Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
      property-by-property basis,
      <br>
      there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
      property B, but not with respect to property A,
      <br>
      even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of
      the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the
      dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
      <br>
      the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
      attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
      <br>
      is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment
      attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.
      <br>
      <br>
      Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a
      return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value
      claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct
      value.
      <br>
      Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a
      substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are
      aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar
      limitation is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property C, when
      aggregated with the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D,
      exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).
      <br>
      <br>
      (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.
      <br>
      <br>
      The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property
      with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be
      400 percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross
      valuation misstatement with respect to such property, therefore,
      and the applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.
      <br>

      HOW TO VALUE A PROPERTY WITH LEGAL INCOME =3D $0.00
      <br>
      (e) Definitions -
      <br>
      <br>
      (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
      adjusted basis of any property claimed on a
      <br>
      return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of
      the correct amount.
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) Gross valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted
      basis of any property claimed on a return of tax
      <br>
      imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
      amount.
      <br>
      <br>
      (3) Property.
      <br>
      For purposes of this section, the term =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82?pr=
operty=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82=C2=9D refers
      to both tangible and intangible property.
      <br>
      Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
      fixtures and inventory.
      <br>
      Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants
      not to compete, leaseholds, patents,
      <br>
      contract rights, debts and choses in action.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -
      <br>
      <br>
      (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are
      substantial or gross.
      <br>
      The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
      valuation misstatement on a return is
      <br>
      made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that
      property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
      <br>
      and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a
      value of 100.
      <br>
      <br>
      Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
      property-by-property basis,
      <br>
      there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
      property B, but not with respect to property A,
      <br>
      even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of
      the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the
      dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
      <br>
      the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
      attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
      <br>
      is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment
      attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.
      <br>
      <br>
      Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a
      return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value
      claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct
      value.
      <br>
      Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a
      substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are
      aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar
      limitation is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property C, when
      aggregated with the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D,
      exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).
      <br>
      <br>
      (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.
      <br>
      <br>
      The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property
      with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be
      400 percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross
      valuation misstatement with respect to such property, therefore,
      and the applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.

      (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good
      faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
      <br>
      Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any
      application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or
      any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in
      a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section
      78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the
      light of the circumstances under which it was made false or
      misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to
      any person (not knowing that such statement was false or
      misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have
      purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such
      statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person
      sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge

      enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of
      competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its
      discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of

      (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the

      where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
      expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.

      Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment,
      the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
      before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the

      liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities;

      [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets
      depends on the
      <br>
      integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
      transparent disclosure.
      <br>
      Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
      fraudulent conduct is
      <br>
      antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long
      held that a history of
      <br>
      egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
      participation in the
      <br>
      securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not
      related to the
      <br>
      professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he
      or she engaged
      <br>
      in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies
      on the fairness
      <br>
      and integrity of all persons associated with each of the
      professions covered by the
      <br>
      collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other

      <br>
      SEC. 17. (a)
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or
      principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other
      than a company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3)
      (A) and (B)), or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter,
      or principal underwriter, acting as principal-
      <br>
      (1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such
      registered company or to any company controlled by such regis-
      tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of
      which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller
      is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the
      holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited
      with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment
      plan by the depositor thereof;
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from
      any company controlled by such registered company, any security or
      other property (except securities of which the seller is the
      issuer)
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
      <br>
      SEC. 17.
      <br>
      (h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
      <br>
      the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of
      association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered
      investment company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which
      such a company is organized or administered, shall contain any
      provision which protects or purports to protect any director or
      officer of such company against any liability to the company or to
      its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by
      reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
      reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
      office.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective
      date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection
      (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration
      of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a
      registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate
      this subsection if prior to said expiration date each such
      director or officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver
      in writing of any protective provision of the instrument to the
      extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and each such
      person subsequently elected or appointed shall before assuming
      office file a similar waiver.
      <br>
      <br>
      (i) After one year from the effective date of this title no
      contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as
      investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
      investment company shall contain any provision which protects or
      purports to protect such person against any liability to such
      company or its security holders to which he would otherwise be
      subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross
      negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his
      reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such
      contract or agreement.

      Injunctions against gross abuse.
      <br>
      SEC. 36.
      <br>
      The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper
      district court of the United States or United States court of
      <br>
      any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
      more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
      enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement
      of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in
      respect of any registered investment company for which such person
      so serves or acts:
      <br>
      (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment
      adviser, or depositor; or
      <br>
      (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
      open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
      <br>
      certificate company.
      <br>
      If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross
      abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person
      from acting in such capacity or capacities either permanently or
      for such period of time as it in its discretion shall deem
      appropriate.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      SEC. 32.
      <br>
      (c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or
      order in the public interest or for the protection of investors,
      to require accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets,
      and other documents and papers relating to registered investment

      CARRIED INTEREST ON BACK TAXES HAS ACCURED THE GREATER OF TWO
      YEARS SINCE THEY FIRST FILED A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.
      <br>
      - TRIED TO KEEP ME OCCUPIED, AND SLOW DOWN THE INEVITABLE (AT THIS
      POINT)
      <br>
      <br>
      SORRY, THEY REFUSE TO COME CLEAN, EVEN ABOUT THE 90-DAY WINDOW
      WHERE STATE FARM WOULD HAVE TERMINATED THE LOAN FOR A BREACH, I
      PUT THE CLAUSE FROM THEIR LOAN ON THE DOCKET (90-DAY DEFAULT
      PROVISION WAS SO THAT STATE FARM CAN WAKE UP AND CANCEL THEIR
      RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE ZZZZUCKERS, IMMEDIATELY) INSTEAD - MORE
      EMAILS AND VIDEO.MOV FILES ALTERED, PHOTOSHOP, AND CIRCULATED
      WITHOUT MY CONSENT BY AND BETWEEN THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL -
      THE INTERIOR OF MY APARTMENT.

      <br>
      - AFTER ALL THOSE FILINGS, AND INVASION... YOU WOULD HAVE TO
      ASSUME AT LEAST ONE OF THESE IDIOTS WOULD WRITE BACK ?
      <br>
      <br>
      - THEY MUST BE AT THE COMMUNITY BOARD , MY BAD... I'LL JUST LET
      THEM STEAL MY MONEY AS WELL, THEY ONLY STOLE ABOUT $500,000,000.00
      IN TAX DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FUNDS..
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      -- CARRIES INTEREST DAILY.
      <br>
      <br>
      #GOCARDS, I ANNEXED THEIR "OUT" IN THE CHANGE TO CAPTION WITHIN
      THE 90-DAY WINDOW. - INSTEAD, OBSTRUCTION WAS A PREFERRED METHOD.
      <br>
      <br>
      - I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO FILE A MOTION, ONLY EXHIBITS.
      <br>
      ALL SIX PROPERTIES BACK 10-YEARS PLUS.
      <br>
      - KNOWN BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL... ALL OF THEM WELL
      VERSED
      <br>
      <br>
      UNTIL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH.
      <br>
      &gt; THAT'S TWO YEARS CARRIED INTEREST... BUT OWED BY STATE FARM
      IMMEDIATELY AND WILL BE "REIUMBURSED" BY THE ZUCKER FAMILY.
      <br>
      <br>
      GOOD LUCK

      prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is
      not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in
      part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until
      another time or to substitute another victim or another but
      similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence

      (b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this
      section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and
      complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant
      prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is
      not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in
      part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until
      another time or to substitute another victim or another but
      similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence
      at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defence by a

his section
      that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime

      because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is
      immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.

      like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring
      those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I
      will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they
      have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering
      the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not
      represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY
      deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC
      guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody
      <br>
      <br>

      not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have
      reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10
      years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a
      natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My

      Despite the breach USC code 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.21, 18.215,
      18.225 - do the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged
      concurrent sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do
      I go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been
      returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money,
      however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a
      growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY
      changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would
      be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank
      that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody
      <br>
      <br>

      been returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my
      money, however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and
      a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent
      YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those
      would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a

      insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United
      States government. Since the FDIC began operations in 1934, no
      depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits.

      ### USC 18. =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7208. Acts affecting a personal finan=
cial interest
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      (a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being
      an officer or employee of the executive branch of the United
      States Government, or of any independent agency of the United
      States, a Federal Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or
      an officer or employee of the District of Columbia, including a
      special Government employee, participates personally and
      substantially as a Government officer or employee, through
      decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of
      advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other
      proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other
      determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation,
      arrest, or other particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he,
      his spouse, minor child, general partner, organization in which he
      is serving as officer, director, trustee, general partner or
      employee, or any person or organization with whom he is
      negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective
      employment, has a financial interest-Shall be subject to the
      penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.
      <br>
      (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-
      <br>
      (1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government
      official responsible for appointment to his or her position of the
      nature and circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding,
      application, request for a ruling or other determination,
      contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other
      particular matter and makes full disclosure of the financial
      interest and receives in advance a written determination made by
      such official that the interest is not so substantial as to be
      deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the
      Government may expect from such officer or employee;
      <br>
      (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of
      Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers
      and employees covered by this section, and published in the
      Federal Register, the financial interest has been exempted from
      the requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or too
      inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the
      Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies;
      <br>
      (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an
      advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory
      Committee Act (including an individual being considered for an
      appointment to such a position), the official responsible for the
      employee's appointment, after review of the financial disclosure
      report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics in
      Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need for the
      individual's services outweighs the potential for a conflict of
      interest created by the financial interest involved...

      (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good
      faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
      <br>
      Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any
      application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or
      any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in
      a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section
      78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the
      light of the circumstances under which it was made false or
      misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to
      any person (not knowing that such statement was false or
      misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have
      purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such
      statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person
      sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge
      that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking to
      enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of
      competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its
      discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of
      such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable

      (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
      Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed
      by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
      conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
      where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
      expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.
      If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the
      Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment,
      the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
      before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the
      Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule,
      if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
      liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities;

      [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets
      depends on the
      <br>
      integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
      transparent disclosure.
      <br>
      Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
      fraudulent conduct is
      <br>
      antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long
      held that a history of
      <br>
      egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
      participation in the
      <br>
      securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not
      related to the
      <br>
      professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he
      or she engaged
      <br>
      in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies
      on the fairness
      <br>
      and integrity of all persons associated with each of the
      professions covered by the
      <br>
      collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other
      market

      -UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
      <br>
      SEC. 17. (a)
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or
      principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other
      than a company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3)
      (A) and (B)), or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter,
      or principal underwriter, acting as principal-
      <br>
      (1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such
      registered company or to any company controlled by such regis-
      tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of
      which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller
      is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the
      holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited
      with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment
      plan by the depositor thereof;
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from
      any company controlled by such registered company, any security or
      other property (except securities of which the seller is the
      issuer)
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
      <br>
      SEC. 17.
      <br>
      (h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
      <br>
      the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of
      association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered
      investment company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which
      such a company is organized or administered, shall contain any
      provision which protects or purports to protect any director or
      officer of such company against any liability to the company or to
      its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by
      reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
      reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
      office.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective
      date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection
      (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration
      of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a
      registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate
      this subsection if prior to said expiration date each such
      director or officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver
      in writing of any protective provision of the instrument to the
      extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and each such
      person subsequently elected or appointed shall before assuming
      office file a similar waiver.
      <br>
      <br>
      (i) After one year from the effective date of this title no
      contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as
      investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
      investment company shall contain any provision which protects or
      purports to protect such person against any liability to such
      company or its security holders to which he would otherwise be
      subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross
      negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his
      reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such
      contract or agreement.

      Injunctions against gross abuse.
      <br>
      SEC. 36.
      <br>
      The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper
      district court of the United States or United States court of
      <br>
      any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
      more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
      enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement
      of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in
      respect of any registered investment company for which such person
      so serves or acts:
      <br>
      (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment
      adviser, or depositor; or
      <br>
      (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
      open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
      <br>
      certificate company.
      <br>
      If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross
      abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person
      from acting in such capacity or capacities either permanently or
      for such period of time as it in its discretion shall deem
      appropriate.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      SEC. 32.
      <br>
      (c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or
      order in the public interest or for the protection of investors,
      to require accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets,
      and other documents and papers relating to registered investment
      companies for such period or periods as the Commission may
      prescribe, and to make the same available for inspection by the
      Commission or any member or representative thereof.

      <br>
      DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
      <br>
      SEC. 34.
      <br>
      <br>
      (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by
      rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
      <br>
      destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document
      the preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31
      (a) or 32 (c).
      <br>
      (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue
      statement of a material fact in any registration statement,
      application, report, account, record, or other document filed or
      transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is
      required pursuant to section 31 (a).
      <br>
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or
      keeping any such document to omit to state therein any fact
      necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in the
      light of the circumstances under which they were made, from being
      materially misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any
      part of any such document which is signed or certified by an
      accountant or auditor in his capacity as such shall be deemed to
      be made, filed, transmitted, or kept by such accountant or
      auditor, as well as by the person filing, transmitting, or keeping
      the complete document.

      <br>
      <br>
      =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.
      <br>
      (a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related
      penalty on any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in
      section 6664(a) and =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6664-2) required to be sh=
own on a
      return if such portion is attributable to one or more of the
      following types of misconduct:
      <br>
      <br>
      (1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see =C3=83?=C3=
=82=C2=A7
      1.6662-3);
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see =C3=83?=C3=82=
=C2=A7
      1.6662-4); or
      <br>
      <br>
      (3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under
      chapter 1 (=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82?substantial valuation misstate=
ment=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82=C2=9D or
      =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82?gross valuation misstatement=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=
=82?=C3=82=C2=9D), provided the applicable
      dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied
      (see =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6662-5).
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      (b) Amount of penalty -
      <br>
      <br>
      (1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20
      percent of the portion of an underpayment
      <br>
      of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to
      any of the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs
      <br>
      (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in
      paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in
      section 6662(h)(2) and =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6662-5(e)(2),
      <br>
      the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the
      portion of an underpayment of tax required
      <br>
      to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross
      valuation misstatement, provided the applicable
      <br>
      dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation missta=
tements under
      chapter 1.
      <br>
      (a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in
      section 6664(a) and
      <br>
      =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapt=
er 1 of
      subtitle A of the Code that is
      <br>
      required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial
      valuation misstatement
      <br>
      under chapter 1 (=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82?substantial valuation mi=
sstatement=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82=C2=9D),
      there is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such
      portion.
      <br>
      <br>
      Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of
      a gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1
      <br>
      (=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82?gross valuation misstatement=C3=83=C2=A2=
=C3=82?=C3=82=C2=9D).
      <br>
      No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a
      portion of an underpayment
      <br>
      that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation
      misstatement unless the aggregate
      <br>
      of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or
      gross valuation misstatements
      <br>
      exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as
      provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
      <br>
      (b) and
      <br>
      (f)(2) of this section.
      <br>
      This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable
      cause and good faith exception to this penalty
      <br>
      set forth in =C3=83?=C3=82=C2=A7 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disc=
losure
      exception to this penalty.
      <br>
      <br>
      (b) Dollar limitation.
      <br>
      No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable
      year unless
      <br>
      <br>
      the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable
      to substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
      <br>
      ($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation
      (as defined in section 1361(a)(1));
      <br>
      <br>
      or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).
      <br>
      <br>
      This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for
      which there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      (e) Definitions -
      <br>
      <br>
      (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
      adjusted basis of any property claimed on a
      <br>
      return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of
      the correct amount.
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) Gross valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted
      basis of any property claimed on a return of tax
      <br>
      imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
      amount.
      <br>
      <br>
      (3) Property.
      <br>
      For purposes of this section, the term =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82?pr=
operty=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82=C2=9D refers
      to both tangible and intangible property.
      <br>
      Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
      fixtures and inventory.
      <br>
      Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants
      not to compete, leaseholds, patents,
      <br>
      contract rights, debts and choses in action.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -
      <br>
      <br>
      (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are
      substantial or gross.
      <br>
      The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
      valuation misstatement on a return is
      <br>
      made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that
      property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
      <br>
      and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a
      value of 100.
      <br>
      <br>
      Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
      property-by-property basis,
      <br>
      there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
      property B, but not with respect to property A,
      <br>
      even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of
      the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the
      dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
      <br>
      the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
      attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
      <br>
      is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment
      attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.
      <br>
      <br>
      Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a
      return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value
      claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct
      value.
      <br>
      Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a
      substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are
      aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar
      limitation is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property C, when
      aggregated with the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D,
      exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).
      <br>
      <br>
      (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.
      <br>
      <br>
      The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property
      with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be
      400 percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross
      valuation misstatement with respect to such property, therefore,
      and the applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.
      <br>

      HOW TO VALUE A PROPERTY WITH LEGAL INCOME =3D $0.00
      <br>
      (e) Definitions -
      <br>
      <br>
      (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
      adjusted basis of any property claimed on a
      <br>
      return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of
      the correct amount.
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) Gross valuation misstatement.
      <br>
      There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted
      basis of any property claimed on a return of tax
      <br>
      imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
      amount.
      <br>
      <br>
      (3) Property.
      <br>
      For purposes of this section, the term =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82?pr=
operty=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82?=C3=82=C2=9D refers
      to both tangible and intangible property.
      <br>
      Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
      fixtures and inventory.
      <br>
      Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants
      not to compete, leaseholds, patents,
      <br>
      contract rights, debts and choses in action.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -
      <br>
      <br>
      (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are
      substantial or gross.
      <br>
      The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
      valuation misstatement on a return is
      <br>
      made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that
      property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
      <br>
      and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a
      value of 100.
      <br>
      <br>
      Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
      property-by-property basis,
      <br>
      there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
      property B, but not with respect to property A,
      <br>
      even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of
      the correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the
      dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
      <br>
      the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
      attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
      <br>
      is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment
      attributable to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.
      <br>
      <br>
      Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a
      return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value
      claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct
      value.
      <br>
      Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a
      substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are
      aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar
      limitation is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property C, when
      aggregated with the portion of the underpayment that is
      attributable to the misstatement of the value of property D,
      exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).
      <br>
      <br>
      (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.
      <br>
      <br>
      The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property
      with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be
      400 percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross
      valuation misstatement with respect to such property, therefore,
      and the applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.
      <br>

      (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good
      faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
      <br>
      Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any
      application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or
      any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in
      a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section
      78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the
      light of the circumstances under which it was made false or
      misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to
      any person (not knowing that such statement was false or
      misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have
      purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such
      statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person
      sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge

      enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of
      competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its
      discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of

      (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
      Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed
      by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
      conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
      where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
      expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.
      If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the
      Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment,
      the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
      before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the
      Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule,
      if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
      liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities;

      [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets
      depends on the
      <br>
      integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
      transparent disclosure.
      <br>
      Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
      fraudulent conduct is
      <br>
      antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long
      held that a history of
      <br>
      egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
      participation in the
      <br>
      securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not
      related to the
      <br>
      professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he
      or she engaged
      <br>
      in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies
      on the fairness
      <br>
      and integrity of all persons associated with each of the
      professions covered by the
      <br>
      collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other
      market

      <br>
      SEC. 17. (a)
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or
      principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other
      than a company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3)
      (A) and (B)), or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter,
      or principal underwriter, acting as principal-
      <br>
      (1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such
      registered company or to any company controlled by such regis-
      tered company, unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of
      which the buyer is the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller
      is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the
      holders of a class of its securities, or (C) securities deposited
      with the trustee of a unit investment trust or periodic payment
      plan by the depositor thereof;
      <br>
      <br>
      (2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from
      any company controlled by such registered company, any security or
      other property (except securities of which the seller is the
      issuer)
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
      <br>
      SEC. 17.
      <br>
      (h) After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
      <br>
      the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of
      association, indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered
      investment company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which
      such a company is organized or administered, shall contain any
      provision which protects or purports to protect any director or
      officer of such company against any liability to the company or to
      its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by
      reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
      reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
      office.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective
      date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection
      (h) and is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration
      of said one year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a
      registered investment company and shall not be deemed to violate
      this subsection if prior to said expiration date each such
      director or officer shall have filed with the Commission a waiver
      in writing of any protective provision of the instrument to the
      extent that it does not comply with this subsection, and each such
      person subsequently elected or appointed shall before assuming
      office file a similar waiver.
      <br>
      <br>
      (i) After one year from the effective date of this title no
      contract or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as
      investment adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
      investment company shall contain any provision which protects or
      purports to protect such person against any liability to such
      company or its security holders to which he would otherwise be
      subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross
      negligence, in the performance of his duties, or by reason of his
      reckless disregard of his obligations and duties under such
      contract or agreement.

      Injunctions against gross abuse.
      <br>
      SEC. 36.
      <br>
      The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper
      district court of the United States or United States court of
      <br>
      any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
      more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
      enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement
      of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in
      respect of any registered investment company for which such person
      so serves or acts:
      <br>
      (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment
      adviser, or depositor; or
      <br>
      (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
      open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
      <br>
      certificate company.
      <br>
      If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross
      abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person
      from acting in such capacity or capacities either permanently or
      for such period of time as it in its discretion shall deem
      appropriate.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      SEC. 32.
      <br>
      (c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or
      order in the public interest or for the protection of investors,
      to require accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets,
      and other documents and papers relating to registered investment
      companies for such period or periods as the Commission may
      prescribe, and to make the same available for inspection by the
      Commission or any member or representative thereof.

      DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
      <br>
      SEC. 34.
      <br>
      <br>
      (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by
      rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
      <br>
      destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document
      the preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31
      (a) or 32 (c).
      <br>
      (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue
      statement of a material fact in any registration statement,
      application, report, account, record, or other document filed or
      transmitted pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is
      required pursuant to section 31 (a).
      <br>
      <br>
      It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or
      keeping any such document to omit to state therein any fact
      necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in the
      light of the circumstances under which they were made, from being
      materially misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any
      part of any such document which is signed or certified by an
      accountant or auditor in his capacity as such shall be deemed to
      be made, filed, transmitted, or kept by such accountant or
      auditor, as well as by the person filing, transmitting, or keeping
      the complete document.

      CARRIED INTEREST ON BACK TAXES HAS ACCURED THE GREATER OF TWO
      YEARS SINCE THEY FIRST FILED A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.
      <br>
      - TRIED TO KEEP ME OCCUPIED, AND SLOW DOWN THE INEVITABLE (AT THIS
      POINT)
      <br>
      <br>
      SORRY, THEY REFUSE TO COME CLEAN, EVEN ABOUT THE 90-DAY WINDOW
      WHERE STATE FARM WOULD HAVE TERMINATED THE LOAN FOR A BREACH, I
      PUT THE CLAUSE FROM THEIR LOAN ON THE DOCKET (90-DAY DEFAULT
      PROVISION WAS SO THAT STATE FARM CAN WAKE UP AND CANCEL THEIR
      RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE ZZZZUCKERS, IMMEDIATELY) INSTEAD - MORE
      EMAILS AND VIDEO.MOV FILES ALTERED, PHOTOSHOP, AND CIRCULATED
      WITHOUT MY CONSENT BY AND BETWEEN THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL -
      THE INTERIOR OF MY APARTMENT.

      - AFTER ALL THOSE FILINGS, AND INVASION... YOU WOULD HAVE TO
      ASSUME AT LEAST ONE OF THESE IDIOTS WOULD WRITE BACK ?
      <br>
      <br>
      - THEY MUST BE AT THE COMMUNITY BOARD , MY BAD... I'LL JUST LET
      THEM STEAL MY MONEY AS WELL, THEY ONLY STOLE ABOUT $500,000,000.00
      IN TAX DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FUNDS..
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      -- CARRIES INTEREST DAILY.
      <br>
      <br>
      #GOCARDS, I ANNEXED THEIR "OUT" IN THE CHANGE TO CAPTION WITHIN
      THE 90-DAY WINDOW. - INSTEAD, OBSTRUCTION WAS A PREFERRED METHOD.
      <br>
      <br>
      - I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO FILE A MOTION, ONLY EXHIBITS.
      <br>
      ALL SIX PROPERTIES BACK 10-YEARS PLUS.
      <br>
      - KNOWN BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL... ALL OF THEM WELL
      VERSED
      <br>
      <br>
      UNTIL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH.
      <br>
      &gt; THAT'S TWO YEARS CARRIED INTEREST... BUT OWED BY STATE FARM
      IMMEDIATELY AND WILL BE "REIUMBURSED" BY THE ZUCKER FAMILY.
      <br>
      <br>

      (a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct
      constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted
      use, or threatened use of physical force against property or
      against the person of another in violation of the laws of the

      that intent, solicits, commands, induces, or otherwise endeavours

      or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more than one-half of
      the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the crime

      (b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this
      section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and
      complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant
      prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is
      not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in
      part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until
      another time or to substitute another victim or another but
      similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence
      at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defence by a
      preponderance of the evidence.

      =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under t=
his section
      that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime
      because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission,
      because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is
      immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.

      constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted
      use, or threatened use of physical force against property or
      against the person of another in violation of the laws of the

      (b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this
      section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and
      complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant
      prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is
      not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in
      part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until
      another time or to substitute another victim or another but
      similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defence
      at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defence by a
      preponderance of the evidence.

      because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is
      immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.

      like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring
      those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I
      will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they
      have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering
      the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not
      represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY
      deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC
      guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      - as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank,

      =C2=A0have NO certificate of occupancy.&lt;br&gt;
      <br>
      <br>
      =C2=A0Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and
      security deposit being held on deposit illegally at JP Morgan
      Chase Bank, but how many other Loans does State Farm have that are
      undisclosed, notwithstanding the legal matter &lt;br&gt;
